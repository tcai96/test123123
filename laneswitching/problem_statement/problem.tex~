\problemname{Lane Switching}

The Autonomous Car Manufacturer (ACM) needs to design algorithms to
control their cars autonomously.  One particular problem is
lane switching---if the car needs to switch lanes, it wants to
do so in the safest manner.

Initially the car is in the leftmost lane, and the car needs to switch
to the rightmost lane.  Fortunately, the car has a variety of sensors
and can obtain the locations of all cars in a section of the highway.
Each car has a length, and its location is given by the lane number
(starting at 0 from the leftmost lane) and the distance of the car
from the beginning of the lane.  This is illustrated below.

Since all other cars are also autonomous, you may assume that all cars
are travelling at exactly the speed limit.  However, the ACM would
like to set itself apart by producing cars that may drive at any speed
regardless of the speed limit, as long as it does not hit any other
car.  For simplicity, you may assume that a lane switch can be done by
moving the car perpendicular to the travel direction of the lane.
This can be done by driving at the speed limit.

When a lane switch occurs, the destination must have unoccupied space
for the car to move into (a perfect fit is allowed).  The switch is
considered safer the more space there is for the car to move through.
We define the safety factor of a lane switch as the closest distance
to any car during the lane switch.  We are only concerned about
cars in the same lane, and will ignore distances between cars in the
different lanes.  The safety factor of a sequence of lane switches is
the minimum of the safety factors of the individual switches.
Obviously, the ACM wants its cars to choose a sequence of lane
switches that has the highest safety factor.  

Since the sensors have limited range, the autonomous cars are not
allowed to drive too far in front or behind the range.  All sensor
readings will be distances from the start of the sensor range.  If the
sensor range is $R$, no part of the ACM car can go before the range or
beyond a distance of $R$ from the start of the range.

Write a program that will determine the highest safety factor
achievable to switch from the leftmost lane to the rightmost lane.

\section*{Input}

The first line of input contains three integers $N$
($2 \leq N \leq 100$), $M$ ($M \geq 1$), $R$
($1 \leq R \leq 1\,000\,000$) indicating the number of lanes, the
number of cars on the road, and the sensor range.  The next $M$ lines
describe each car with three integers: the lane number (between 0 and
$N-1$, inclusive), the length of the car, and the distance from the
start of the sensor range to the back of the car.  The distance will
be at most $R$.  The first car given is the ACM car.

There are at most 100 cars in each lane.


\section*{Output}

Print a single number indicating the maximum achievable safety factor
to switch from lane 0 to lane $N-1$.  Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-5}$.
