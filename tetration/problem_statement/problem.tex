\problemname{Tetration}

Anthony is just now learning basic math, how exciting! He first learns about addition
\[
a+n=a+\underbrace{1+1+\cdots+1}_n,
\]
then multiplication
\[
a\times n=\underbrace{a+a+\cdots+a}_n,
\]
exponentiation
\[
a^n=\underbrace{a\times a\times\cdots\times a}_n.
\]
and finally, \emph{tetration}
\[
^na=\underbrace{a^{a^{\rddots a}}}_n.
\]

Very quickly, Anthony becomes interested in infinite tetrations, namely
\[
^\infty a={a^{a^{\rddotse}}}.
\]
Anthony wonders, given an arbitrary real number $N$, what is the solution to $^\infty a=N$? Unable to figure it out, Anthony has asked you to write a program to help him!

Here's a fun fact: A solution only exists for $\frac{1}{e}\leq N\leq e$.

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains one real number $N$, $0.36788\leq N\leq2.718281$.

\section*{Output}
Output a single line containing a real number $a$, such that $^\infty a=N$. 
Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-5}$.
